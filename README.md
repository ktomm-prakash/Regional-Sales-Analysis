# Regional-Sales-Analysis
This project performs an in-depth analysis of a company's regional sales data. Using multiple sheets from a comprehensive Excel file, the notebook explores sales performance by customer, region, product, and budget, helping stakeholders understand revenue patterns and identify growth opportunities.

# üß† Business Problem
A company is seeking to improve its sales performance across different states and regions. Despite having access to detailed sales orders, customer data, product catalogs, and budget targets, decision-makers lack clarity on:

- Which regions or states are underperforming?
- Who are the top customers and what products are driving revenue?
- How does actual sales performance compare with budget targets?
- Are there specific product categories that need more focus?

The objective is to derive actionable insights from this multi-sheet sales dataset to support data-driven decisions in marketing, budgeting, and sales strategy.

# üóÇÔ∏è Dataset
The dataset (Regional Sales Dataset.xlsx) contains the following sheets:

- Sales Orders: Transaction-level sales data
- Customers: Customer information including locations
- Regions: Geographic regions of operation
- State Regions: Mapping of states to broader regions
- Products: Product information
- 2017 Budgets: Sales budget targets by region

# üîç Key Analysis Tasks

- Data cleaning and preprocessing (missing values, renaming columns)
- Merging datasets across sheets
- Regional and state-level sales aggregation
- Budget vs. actual sales performance comparison
- Visualization of top customers, product performance, and geographic trends

# üìà Tools and Libraries

- Pandas for data manipulation
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
